# Commerce

Welcome to the Commerce repository! This project is an assignment for the CS50 Web Development Course [CS50 Web](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/).

## Project Overview

Commerce is an online commerce site with an auction system. Users can create listings of items on the site and other users can place bids on those listings. The seller can close a listing when they are satisfied with the current highest bid, and the user with the highest bid will be assigned as the winner.

The project aims to implement the specifications provided in the [CS50 Web Project 2: Commerce](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/#specification). It includes the following features:

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register an account and log in to access the site's features.
- **Listings**: Users can create listings for items they want to sell, providing details such as the item's title, description, starting bid, and an optional image URL.
- **Bidding**: Users can place bids on active listings, with the current highest bid displayed on the listing page.
- **Comments**: Users can add comments to a listing, discussing the item or asking questions.
- **Categories**: Listings are categorized by their respective categories for easier navigation and filtering.
- **Watchlist**: Users can add listings to their personal watchlist to keep track of items they are interested in.
- **Closing Listings**: Sellers can close their listings, ending the auction and assigning the highest bidder as the winner.
- **User Profile**: Users have a profile page where they can view their own listings, bids, and watchlist.
